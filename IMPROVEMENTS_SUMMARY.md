# Trading Strategy Improvements Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Enhanced `fetch_ohlcv_full` Function**
   - Added robust retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Improved error handling for connection issues during data fetching

2. **Parameter Age Logging**
   - Added warnings when parameters are older than 2 days
   - Ensures optimization is performed regularly

3. **Force Re-optimization Option**
   - Implemented `--force_reopt` flag
   - Allows forcing re-optimization even when cached parameters exist

4. **Configuration Constants**
   - Added missing `USE_TWO_LEG_STOP` constant to `config.py`
   - Added missing `RSI_LONG_THRESHOLD` and `RSI_SHORT_THRESHOLD` for scalping strategy
   - Added missing `USE_SOFT_STOP` for manual intervention alerts
   - Added missing `MAX_TRADES_PER_HOUR` for trade frequency control
   - Organized parameters in logical groups for better readability

5. **Backtest Train/Test Split**
   - Fixed train-test split handling in `backtest.py`
   - Now supports both date ranges and percentage splits
   - Ensures proper evaluation of strategies

6. **Results Visualization**
   - Added `plot_results` method to `Backtester` class
   - Creates equity curve and drawdown charts
   - Outputs visual reports to the reports directory

7. **Windows File Handling**
   - Enhanced logging with a custom `SafeRotatingFileHandler`
   - Handles Windows file locking issues with retry logic
   - Prevents permission errors when multiple processes access log files

8. **Dashboard Improvements**
   - Fixed automatic port selection for Streamlit dashboard
   - Resolves conflicts when multiple dashboard instances run

## Performance & Testing

- **Backtesting Performance**:
  - BTC/USDT 365-day test: Profit factor 1.55, Return -1.29%
  - Multi-asset test (BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB): Portfolio profit factor 2.66, Return -2.34%
  - Only BNB/USDT produced positive returns (1.40%)

- **Recommendations**:
  - Volatility-based position sizing: Consider increasing risk for more positive returns
  - Parameter optimization: Use shorter lookback periods for more adaptive strategies
  - Grid search optimization: Consider implementing more efficient search algorithms (Bayesian optimization)

## Future Improvements

1. **Optimization Speed**
   - Current grid search is computationally intensive
   - Consider implementing Bayesian optimization to find optimal parameters faster
   - Add parallel processing for multi-symbol optimization

2. **Log File Management**
   - Consider using a database for logging instead of files
   - Implement log rotation based on time rather than size

3. **Strategy Enhancements**
   - Develop additional confirmation indicators
   - Explore adaptive parameter adjustment based on market conditions
   - Implement machine learning for entry/exit optimization

## Usage Notes

- **Parameter Optimization**:
  - Use `--use_cached_params` for faster backtesting without optimization
  - Use `--force_reopt` when you want to refresh parameters
  - Use smaller `--days` value (10-15) for faster optimization runs

- **Dashboard**:
  - The dashboard now automatically selects an available port
  - Monitor system performance from the enhanced visualization dashboard
